An upcoming mod for Crusader Kings III, adding more historical accuracy to Anatolia with the Sultanate of Rûm

This is a much bigger effort than my previous mods, so it will take quite some time to put it together. (I also keep getting dragged into rabbit holes of Wikipedia articles... so much to learn!)
