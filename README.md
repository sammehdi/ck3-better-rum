Note: this has nothing to do with alcohol, I assure you. "Rûm" actually referred to Rome, as in the Roman Empire.

A mod for Crusader Kings III, adding more historical accuracy to Anatolia with the Sultanate of Rûm

Historically, the Great Seljuk Empire took over nearly all of Asia Minor. One of the states to come out of this incursion was the Sultanate of Rûm, which gained its independence in 1077. However, this never happens in game. This mod fixes that!

# Specific Changelog
- Installed Suleyman ibn Qutulmish in Marash, on the border between the Byzantine and Seljuk Empires. Gave him ~1000 troops so he wouldn't immediate die
- Created new events that are triggered when the Seljuks win the Invasion of Armenia
- Created new casus belli that the Seljuk Emperor can use to invade nearly all of Asia Minor
- AI will always use this casus belli on 1080.1.1, even if they have a truce with the Byzantines
- Suleyman joins Seljuk Emperor when Seljuk Emperor declares war for Asia Minor
- Suleyman installs himself as Sultan of Rum once that war is won, with the Seljuk Emperor getting a pressed claim to the Sultanate of Rum
- Added very strong modifier to simulate Turkish immigration to Asia Minor following the invasion
- Buffed the following characters: Suleyman ibn Qutalmish, his son Kilij Arslan, Seljuk successor Malik Shah, Alexios Komnenos
- Set Malik Shah as Seljuk Emperor's designated heir (to follow history)
That's about it!
