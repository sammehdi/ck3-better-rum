An upcoming mod for Crusader Kings III, adding more historical accuracy to Anatolia with the Sultanate of Rûm

Historically, the Great Seljuk Empire took over nearly all of Asia Minor. One of the states to come out of this incursion was the Sultanate of Rûm, which gained its independence in 1077. However, this never happens in game. This mod fixes that!

This is a much bigger effort than my previous mods, so it will take quite some time to put it together. (I also keep getting dragged into rabbit holes of Wikipedia articles... so much to learn!)
